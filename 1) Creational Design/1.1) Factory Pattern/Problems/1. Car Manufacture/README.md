# Car Manufacture

You are working for a car manufacturing company that produces different types of cars: Sedan, SUV, and Truck. Each car type has its own implementation of the `drive` method. You have been tasked to support new car types in the future without modifying the existing codebase.

### Solution:

To solve this problem, we can use the Factory Design Pattern. The Factory Pattern allows us to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client and refers to the newly created object using a common interface.
