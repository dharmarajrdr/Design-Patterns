### **Prototype Design Pattern**  

The **Prototype Design Pattern** is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying or cloning existing ones rather than instantiating new objects from scratch. This pattern is useful when object creation is expensive, and creating a copy is more efficient.

---

### **Key Concepts:**
1. **Prototype Interface**:
   - Defines a method for cloning objects.  
   - Typically uses the `clone()` method from Java's `Cloneable` interface.

2. **Concrete Prototype**:
   - A class that implements the prototype interface and provides the actual implementation of the `clone()` method.

3. **Client**:
   - Uses the prototype to create new objects by cloning existing ones.

---

### **Benefits:**
- **Improves performance**: Reduces the overhead of creating new instances, especially for costly object creation.
- **Simplifies object creation**: Avoids re-initialization of the state for a new object.
- **Supports complex object structures**: Cloning can include deeply nested objects.

---

### **Considerations While Using the Prototype Pattern**:

1. **Shallow vs. Deep Cloning**:
   - **Shallow Cloning**: Copies the object's fields but not the objects referenced by the fields.
   - **Deep Cloning**: Copies the object along with all objects it references.

2. **Cloneable Interface in Java**:
   - In Java, the `Cloneable` interface needs to be implemented to use the `clone()` method.  
   - Failing to implement it results in a `CloneNotSupportedException`.

3. **Complex Objects**:
   - Be cautious when dealing with objects that contain references to other objects. You may need deep cloning to avoid shared references.

4. **Immutability**:
   - If the object being cloned contains immutable fields, shallow copying is usually sufficient.

5. **Resource Management**:
   - Ensure that the cloned object handles resources (e.g., file handles, database connections) correctly to avoid resource leaks or conflicts.

### **Example of Prototype Pattern in Java**:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Document implements Cloneable {
    private String title;
    private List<String> pages;

    public Document(String title, List<String> pages) {
        this.title = title;
        this.pages = pages;
    }

    @Override
    protected Document clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        // Deep clone
        List<String> clonedPages = new ArrayList<>(pages);
        return new Document(this.title, clonedPages);
    }

    public void addPage(String page) {
        pages.add(page);
    }

    public List<String> getPages() {
        return pages;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Document{title='" + title + "', pages=" + pages + "}";
    }
}

public class PrototypeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        List<String> pages = new ArrayList<>();
        pages.add("Page 1");

        Document original = new Document("Original", pages);
        Document clone = original.clone();

        clone.addPage("Page 2");
        System.out.println("Original: " + original);
        System.out.println("Clone: " + clone);
    }
}
```

### **Interview Questions on Prototype Design Pattern**:

1. **Conceptual Questions**:
   - What is the Prototype Design Pattern, and when would you use it?
   - How does the Prototype Pattern differ from the Singleton Pattern?
   - What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the Prototype Pattern?

2. **Technical/Implementation Questions**:
   - What is the difference between shallow cloning and deep cloning? Provide examples.
   - How do you implement cloning in Java? What is the role of the `Cloneable` interface?
   - What challenges might you face when cloning objects with complex references (e.g., circular references)?

3. **Behavioral Questions**:
   - How would you handle cloning if your object contains file handles or database connections?
   - Have you ever used the Prototype Pattern in a project? Explain the scenario and the outcome.

4. **Advanced Questions**:
   - Can you implement deep cloning without relying on the `Cloneable` interface? How?
   - How would you implement the Prototype Pattern in a language that doesn't support object cloning natively?


### **What is a Prototype Registry?**

A **Prototype Registry** is a centralized place where pre-configured prototype objects are stored. This allows clients to easily access and clone these prototypes without worrying about their instantiation or configuration.

---

### **Purpose of the Prototype Registry**:
1. **Centralized Management**:
   - Keeps track of all available prototypes.
   - Simplifies the client code by providing ready-to-use prototypes.

2. **Encapsulation**:
   - Hides the complexity of creating or configuring the prototypes from the client.

3. **Reusability**:
   - Allows reuse of pre-configured objects by cloning them, avoiding repetitive initialization.

---

### **How the Registry Works**:

1. **Store Prototypes**:
   - The registry stores different prototype objects, often in a `Map` with unique keys.

2. **Retrieve and Clone**:
   - The client retrieves a prototype by key and clones it to get a new instance.

3. **Customize Cloned Object**:
   - The cloned object can be further customized as needed.

### **Implementation of Prototype Registry in Java**:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

// Prototype Interface
interface Shape extends Cloneable {
    Shape clone();
    void draw();
}

// Concrete Prototype 1
class Circle implements Shape {
    private String color;

    public Circle(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    @Override
    public Circle clone() {
        return new Circle(this.color);
    }

    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a " + color + " circle.");
    }
}

// Concrete Prototype 2
class Rectangle implements Shape {
    private String color;

    public Rectangle(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    @Override
    public Rectangle clone() {
        return new Rectangle(this.color);
    }

    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a " + color + " rectangle.");
    }
}

// Prototype Registry
class ShapeRegistry {
    private Map<String, Shape> registry = new HashMap<>();

    public void addPrototype(String key, Shape shape) {
        registry.put(key, shape);
    }

    public Shape getPrototype(String key) {
        return registry.get(key).clone();
    }
}

// Client
public class PrototypeRegistryExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShapeRegistry registry = new ShapeRegistry();

        // Register prototypes
        registry.addPrototype("RedCircle", new Circle("Red"));
        registry.addPrototype("BlueRectangle", new Rectangle("Blue"));

        // Retrieve and clone prototypes
        Shape clonedCircle = registry.getPrototype("RedCircle");
        Shape clonedRectangle = registry.getPrototype("BlueRectangle");

        clonedCircle.draw(); // Output: Drawing a Red circle.
        clonedRectangle.draw(); // Output: Drawing a Blue rectangle.
    }
}
```

### **Benefits of Using a Registry**:
1. **Simplifies Object Creation**: Clients donâ€™t need to create or configure prototypes themselves.
2. **Promotes Reusability**: Prototypes in the registry can be reused across different parts of the system.
3. **Reduces Coupling**: Clients depend on the registry, not the specific classes of the prototypes.
