### Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that **provides an interface for creating objects** in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. Rather than calling a constructor directly to create an object, the **Factory Pattern uses a factory method to create an object**. This pattern is useful <u>when the exact type of the object cannot be determined until runtime</u> or when the creation process involves some logic that should not be duplicated across the codebase.

### Real-Life Example

**Scenario: Car Manufacturing**

Imagine a car manufacturing company that produces different types of cars, such as Sedan, SUV, and Truck. Instead of having the car dealership create specific car objects (which can lead to tight coupling and duplicate code), the company uses a factory to create cars.

##### Step 1: Define a common interface (or abstract class)

```java
// Car.java
public interface Car {
    void drive();
}
```

##### Step 2: Create concrete classes implementing the same interface

```java
// Sedan.java
public class Sedan implements Car {
    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a sedan...");
    }
}

// SUV.java
public class SUV implements Car {
    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving an SUV...");
    }
}

// Truck.java
public class Truck implements Car {
    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a truck...");
    }
}
```

##### Step 3: Create a Factory class to generate objects of the concrete classes based on given information

```java
// CarFactory.java
public class CarFactory {
    public Car createCar(String carType) {
        if (carType == null || carType.isEmpty()) {
            return null;
        }
        switch (carType) {
            case "Sedan":
                return new Sedan();
            case "SUV":
                return new SUV();
            case "Truck":
                return new Truck();
            default:
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown car type: " + carType);
        }
    }
}
```

##### Step 4: Use the Factory class to get the object of concrete classes by passing an information such as type

```java
// FactoryPatternDemo.java
public class FactoryPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CarFactory carFactory = new CarFactory();

        // Create a Sedan
        Car car1 = carFactory.createCar("Sedan");
        car1.drive();

        // Create an SUV
        Car car2 = carFactory.createCar("SUV");
        car2.drive();

        // Create a Truck
        Car car3 = carFactory.createCar("Truck");
        car3.drive();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

In the above example:
1. **Car Interface**: Represents the product interface with a common method `drive`.
2. **Concrete Car Classes (Sedan, SUV, Truck)**: These classes implement the `Car` interface and provide their own implementation of the `drive` method.
3. **Car Factory**: This class contains a method `createCar` which takes a `String` argument to determine the type of car to create. It returns an instance of the corresponding car type.
4. **FactoryPatternDemo**: This is the client code that uses the `CarFactory` to create different types of cars without needing to know the specifics of car creation.

### Benefits
- **Encapsulation**: The <u>creation logic is encapsulated in one place</u> (the factory), making the code easier to manage and understand.
- **Loose Coupling**: The client code is decoupled from the concrete classes it needs to instantiate.
- **Scalability**: New types of cars can be added with minimal changes to the client code. Just add a new class that implements the `Car` interface and update the `CarFactory` accordingly.
