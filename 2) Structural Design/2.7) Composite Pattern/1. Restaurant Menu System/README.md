## Build a “Restaurant Menu System”

Design a menu structure for a restaurant that can contain:

* **Individual items** (like “Burger”, “Fries”, “Coke”)
* **Sub-menus** (like “Veg Menu”, “Drinks Menu”, “Combo Menu”)
* And even **nested menus** (like “Desserts → Ice Creams → Premium Flavors”)

You should be able to:

* Print the **entire menu** neatly.
* Support **adding/removing** menu items.
* Treat both a **single menu item** and a **menu group** uniformly.
